# Magical Unicorn Search Page

This project features a simple search page with a magical unicorn-themed background, designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page includes a search box, filtering options, and dynamic result display, all wrapped in a vibrant and colorful design inspired by unicorn colors.

## Features:
- **Search Functionality**: Users can input search terms, which will filter through a list of predefined articles.
- **Category Filtering**: Articles can be filtered by category (e.g., Technology, Health, Travel).
- **Dynamic Results Display**: Articles that match the search term and selected category will be displayed dynamically.
- **Responsive Design**: The page is fully mobile-friendly, adjusting automatically to different screen sizes.
- **Magical Unicorn Background**: A pastel-colored gradient animation that gives the webpage a magical and vibrant aesthetic.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: Structure of the page.
- **CSS**: Styling the page with modern designs and animations (including a unicorn-inspired gradient background).
- **JavaScript**: Handling search and filtering functionality.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the page looks great on mobile devices.
